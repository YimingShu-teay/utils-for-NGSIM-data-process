### Brief Introduction

This code was written quite some time ago for the purpose of processing the NGSIM dataset. While it might not be the epitome of organization or high efficiency, it should serve as a valuable starting point for those venturing into data processing.

This data processing is aimed at **extracting lane-changing points of vehicles and capturing feature information of traffic flow scenarios during lane changes**.
